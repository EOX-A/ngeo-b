# Optional. The configured URL to send notifications to. By default,
# notifications are sent to the same IP address as with the CTRL was registered

#harvesting_via_sxcat=false

# ngEO Browse Server general configuration parameters
[control.ingest]

# Mandatory. Path to the temporary browse image storage for images awaiting
# ingestion. Usually this is the directory where the FEED subsystem uploads the
# browse images to.
storage_dir=data/storage

# Mandatory. Path to a directory to store the originals of successfully
# ingested browse images. Either absolute or relative to PROJECT_DIR as defined
# in "settings.py".
success_dir=data/success

# Mandatory. Path to a directory to store originals of browse images which
# failed to ingest. Either absolute or relative to PROJECT_DIR.
failure_dir=data/failure

# Optional. Boolean value to indicate if the originals of successfully ingested
# browse images should be deleted. Default is "true".
#delete_on_success=true

# Mandatory. Path to a directory to store optimized datasets for later
# delivery. The path may either be given relative to the PROJECT_DIR, or
# absolute.
optimized_files_dir=data/optimized/

# Optinal. String that is attached at the end of filenames of optimized
# datasets. Default is empty.
optimized_files_postfix=_proc

# Optional. Compression method used. One of "JPEG", "LZW", "PACKBITS",
# "DEFLATE", "CCITTRLE", "CCITTFAX3", "CCITTFAX4", or "NONE". Default is "NONE"
compression=LZW

# Optional. JPEG quality if compression is "JPEG". Integer between 1-100.
# Default: 75
#jpeg_quality=75

# Optional. zlevel option for "DEFLATE" compression. Integer between 1-9.
# Default: 6
#zlevel=6

# Optional. Defines whether or not the image shall be tiled. Default is "true".
#tiling=true

# Optional. Defines whether overviews shall be generated. Default is "true".
#overviews=true

# Optional. Defines the resampling method used to generate the overviews.
# One of "NEAREST", "GAUSS", "CUBIC", "AVERAGE", "MODE", "AVERAGE_MAGPHASE"
# or "NONE". Defaults to "NEAREST"
#overview_resampling=NEAREST

# Optional. A comma separated list of integer overview levels. Defaults to
# a automatic selection of overview levels according to the dataset size.
#overview_levels=2,4,8,16

# Optional. A (positive) integer value declaring the lowest size the highest
# overview level at most shall have. Defaults to "256".
#overview_minsize=256

# Optional. Defines if a color index shall be calculated. Default is "false".
#color_index=false

# Optional. Defines whether or not a alpha channel shall be used to display the
# images area of interest. Default is "false".
footprint_alpha=true

# Optional. If set to a number, the areas with values of all three bands
# equal to color and similar to it by +-15 will get burned to alpha channel
# as transparent. Default is "false".
color_to_alpha=0

# Optional. Sets the maximum threshold for the sieve algorithm. See
# `http://www.gdal.org/gdal__alg_8h.html#a33309c0a316b223bd33ae5753cc7f616`
# for details. Defaults to the number of pixels divided by 16
# which is indicated by a value of 0.
#sieve_max_threshold=0

# Optional. Sets the factor for the simplification algorithm. See
# `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm`
# for details. Defaults to 2 (2 * resolution == 2 pixels) which provides
# reasonable results.
#simplification_factor=2

# Optional and for debugging purposes only. Do not move any original raster file
# from the storage directory after a successful/failed ingest.
# Defaults to "false".
#leave_original=false


# Optional. Sets the "strategy" for when an ingested browse is equal with an
# existing one.
# The "merge"-strategy tries to merge the two existing images to
# one single. This is only possible if the time difference of the two browse
# reports (the report of the to be ingested browse and the one of the already
# existing one) is lower than the threshold. Otherwise a "replace" is done.
# The "replace" strategy removes the previous browse, before ingesting the new
# one.
# The "skip" strategy skips the ingestion when the new browse is not newer
# than the already ingested one.
# Defaults to "replace".
#strategy=replace

# Optional. The maximum time difference between the two browse reports to allow
# a "merge". E.g: 1w 5d 3h 12m 18ms. Defaults to "5h"
#merge_threshold=5h

# Optional. Clip the regular grid tie points pixel coordinates to be inside of
# the image bounds. Necessary for Sentinel-1 image data.
#regular_grid_clipping=false

# Optional. When set to "true", all pre-processing is done with in-memory
# datasets. For smaller ones, this might be beneficial in terms of performance,
# but it is safer to directly use files (which is the default).
#in_memory=false

# MapCache related configuration values
[mapcache]
# Mandatory. Path to root directory that shall contain the cached tilesets.
tileset_root=

# Optional. The default value for WMS/WMTS queries that lack a time value.
# This is the default value for browse layers.
#timedimension_default=2014

# Optional. The default positive integer value to limit the images to be
# stacked when querying a time interval of a certain tile.
# This is the default value for browse layers.
#tile_query_limit_default=100

[mapcache.seed]

# Mandatory. Absolute path to the MapCache XML configuration file for
# seeding purposes.
config_file=

# Optional. The MapCache seed command. Defaults to "mapcache_seed".
#seed_command=mapcache_seed

# Optional. Integer number of threads to use while seeding. Defaults to "1".
#threads=1

# Optional. Number of seconds to wait for the mapcache configuration lockfile
# when trying to seed the cache. When not set, the operation immediately
# returns an error. This setting is required to allow semi-parallel ingests.
# Defaults to 60 seconds.
timeout=60
