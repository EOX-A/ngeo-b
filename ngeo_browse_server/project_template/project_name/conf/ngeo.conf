# ngEO Browse Server general configuration parameters
[control.ingest]

# ingested browse images. Either absolute or relative to PROJECT_DIR as defined 
# in "settings.py".

# Mandatory. Path to a directory to store originals of browse images which
# failed to ingest. Either absolute or relative to PROJECT_DIR.
failure_dir=data/failure

# Optional. Boolean value to indicate if the originals of successfully ingested 
# browse images should be deleted. Default is "true".
